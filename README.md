# Crewmeister Absence Manager

This interface was created by me, Rafael Weiss, for to the Crewmeister coding challange. This app helps you manage the absences of your employees.

#Setup

You will need npm to run this application, I recommend an updated one since I used the version 10.21.0.

If you don't have Node.js and npm installed:

`sudo apt update`

`sudo apt install nodejs`

`sudo apt install npm`

After installing Node.js and npm, go to the js_edition folder and run npm install: 

`cd js_edition`

`npm install`

Wait for the installation to finish, then run npm start to open the program on localhost:3000:

`npm start`

To run the tests use npm test:

`npm test`
